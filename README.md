```

2. Click "Fetch Prices" to query the Scryfall API
3. View results in the sortable table

## üì∏ Workflow for Physical Card Collections

### Step 1: Photograph Cards
- Arrange 10-15 cards in rows
- Ensure card names are clearly visible
- Good lighting, avoid glare
- Straight-on angle works best

### Step 2: Parse Card Names
Use Claude or manual entry to identify card names from photos.

### Step 3: Identify Sets (Optional but Recommended)
- **Modern cards**: Look at bottom of card for 3-letter set code
- **Older cards**: Identify set symbol (small icon on middle-right)
- **Very old cards** (pre-1995): May have no set symbol - research needed

### Step 4: Enter and Price
Paste card list into tool, run pricing, export results.

### Step 5: Flag for Research
Cards showing $0.00 or suspiciously low prices may need manual verification, especially:
- Cards with old card frames (pre-2003)
- Vintage printings vs modern reprints
- Reserved List cards

## üéØ Use Cases

### For Collectors
- Quickly value your collection
- Identify valuable cards worth protecting
- Track collection value over time
- Export to spreadsheets for insurance purposes

### For Deck Builders
- Price out deck lists before buying
- Compare prices across different printings
- Find budget alternatives

### For Sellers
- Bulk price cards for listing
- Identify high-value cards to sell individually
- Export pricing data for inventory management

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Pricing Accuracy
- Prices from Scryfall represent market averages
- Actual selling prices vary by condition
- Vintage cards: Tool may show recent reprint prices if set code not specified
- Some rare cards show $0.00 (no market data available)

### Set Code Identification
**Always specify set codes for vintage cards!**

Example price differences:
- Lightning Bolt (Alpha): ~$350
- Lightning Bolt (Modern reprint): ~$1

Without set codes, you'll see the modern price even if you own the valuable Alpha version.

### Rate Limiting
- Tool includes 100ms delay between requests
- Respects Scryfall API guidelines
- Large collections (100+ cards) will take time to process
